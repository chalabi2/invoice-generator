InvoiceGenerator Source-Available License (IG-SAL) v1.0

Copyright (c) 2026 Joseph Chalabi

NOTICE
This license is "source-available" and is NOT an OSI-approved open source license.
It allows public access to the source code and broad use of the Licensor-operated hosted service,
but it requires a paid license for Commercial Self-Hosting (defined below).

1. DEFINITIONS

"Licensor" means Joseph Chalabi.

"Software" means the software and associated source code, documentation, build scripts,
configuration files, and other materials made available in the repository titled
"invoicegenerator.com" (the "Project"), including any modifications or derivative works
you create from it, to the extent those modifications or derivative works are based on the Software.

"Hosted Service" means the publicly available, Licensor-operated hosted invoice generator service
made available by Licensor (for example, a service operated by Licensor under the Project brand).

"Instance" means a single deployed runtime environment capable of serving invoice generation
functionality to one or more users, regardless of whether it runs in a container, VM, bare metal,
Kubernetes pod(s), or similar. A horizontally scaled deployment counts as one Instance if it is
one logical installation serving the same tenant or organization and is operated as a single system.
Separate tenants or separate installations are separate Instances.

"Self-Host" or "Self-Hosting" means running or deploying the Software on infrastructure that you
(or your organization) control, including your own servers, your own cloud account, or any hosting
provider where you control the environment.

"Commercial Purpose" means use that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage
or monetary compensation. Commercial Purpose includes, without limitation:
(a) using the Software in the operation of a business;
(b) using the Software to provide services to customers or third parties;
(c) offering the Software or its functionality as a hosted service, managed service, or SaaS;
(d) internal business use in production, even if you do not charge end users directly.
Commercial Purpose does NOT include bona fide personal use, hobby use, academic use, or
non-profit use where no fees are charged for access to the Software or its functionality,
and the use is not part of a for-profit business operation.

"Non-Commercial Use" means any use that is not a Commercial Purpose.

"Production Use" means use in a live environment supporting real users, real data, or real business
processes, excluding reasonable evaluation, testing, or development.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

Subject to the terms of this License, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
license to:
(a) view, download, and modify the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
(b) Self-Host the Software for Non-Commercial Use;
(c) use the Hosted Service at no charge, provided you comply with any reasonable usage limits,
abuse prevention measures, and terms presented within the Hosted Service (the "Hosted Terms");
(d) redistribute the Software (source or binary) ONLY for Non-Commercial Use and ONLY if you
include this License and all copyright notices.

3. COMMERCIAL SELF-HOSTING REQUIRES A PAID LICENSE

If you Self-Host the Software for any Commercial Purpose, you must purchase a commercial license
from Licensor for each Instance.

Without a commercial license, you may NOT:
(a) Self-Host the Software for Production Use in a for-profit business;
(b) provide the Software or its functionality to others as a service (SaaS/hosted/managed service);
(c) resell, license, or otherwise monetize a Self-Hosted deployment;
(d) remove or obscure licensing, copyright, or attribution notices.

4. CONTRIBUTIONS

If you submit contributions (code, documentation, issues, or pull requests), you grant Licensor
a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, relicense,
and distribute your contributions as part of the Software under this License and/or under separate
commercial terms. You represent that you have the right to make the contribution.

5. TRADEMARKS AND BRANDING

This License does not grant any rights to use Licensor’s trademarks, service marks, or logos.
You may make truthful statements that your product or service uses the Software, but you may not
suggest endorsement by Licensor.

6. LICENSE TERMINATION

This License terminates automatically if you violate its terms. Upon termination, you must cease
all use and distribution of the Software, except that any recipients who received the Software from
you in compliance with this License may retain their rights under this License.

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE AND HOSTED SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU BEAR ALL RISK OF USING THE SOFTWARE OR HOSTED SERVICE.

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA,
OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE, THE SOFTWARE, OR THE HOSTED
SERVICE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY
CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD $100).
